# Fullstack Project @ IT-Högskolan in Gothenburg

DevAcademy is a web application designed for web enthusiasts who want to improve their skills and explore new technologies. Users can browse a wide range of courses, purchase the ones they’re interested in, and leave reviews upon completion to share their experience. After completing a course, users receive a certificate to showcase their achievements. The application features a user dashboard where learners can update their account information, download certificates for completed courses, and leave reviews to share their feedback.

**Note:**
If you want to use the dashboard, you can create a new account or log in to an existing one to access all features.
